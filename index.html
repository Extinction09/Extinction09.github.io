                        of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Aviation Vehicle Design competition (quite the mouthful, so instead I'll call it AVD) with the ultimate goal
                        of having the highest maximum speed in order to win. Most of the concepts related to aircraft design were foreign to our team, so as team lead, I guided
                        our team to creating a solid contender in the compeition.

                        It left a lot to be desired (for me personally), and eventually led to a large overhaul.

                    <span class="hook">Discouraged from the failure of the Mako,</span> I needed to prove to myself that I was capable of making a flyable remote control aircraft.
                    A few days after the crash, I began thoroughly researching the possible causes. Was it the size of my ailerons? Was it the geometry
                    of my wing? The obvious wingtip stalling led me to believe these could be the probable causes for a little over a week. It wasn't until I 
                    slowed the video down of the crash that the answer finally clicked. It was a center of gravity error. My ailerons were properly sized, and
                    the taper ratio of the wing shouldn't have caused that extreme of a departure or else some of the other contestants wouldn't have flown
                    successfully (A side effect of this research also showed that the area of the vertical stabilizer was under recommended limits,
                    but only by around 5%).

                    <span class="hook">Reflection: </span> While the rest of the plane was handled with utter care and attention to detail in its construction and design, its
                    center of gravity was neglected in the design phase and ultimately led to a catastrophic failure. Future design changes can include a lighter empennage,
                    lighter aft fuselage, and/or moving the wings further away from the nose.
